# Cambrium

An artificial life simulation where creatures evolve to hunt for food. Creatures have bodies with eyes, mouths, and engines, connected by neural networks that learn during their lifetime.

## [Live Demo](https://douwe.com/projects/cambrium)

## Features

- **Multi-segment bodies** with customizable shapes
- **Radial symmetry** (1-5 fold) with optional mirroring
- **Neural network brains** that learn through experience
- **Lamarckian inheritance** - learned behaviors pass to offspring
- **Spatial hashing** for efficient collision detection
- **Real-time visualization** with creature inspection
